            	<h2>Why Recast?</h2>
            	
                <p>Recast is designed to make it convenient to listen to all the old episodes of a podcast from the beginning.</p>
                
                <p>Most podcast clients will only automatically present the latest episode of a podcast and leave you to manually download previous episodes one by one, eliminating
                    the convenience of automatic delivery.</p>
                


                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                
                <p>Instead of subscribing directly to the podcast, you give Recast the address of the website or feed of the podcast and it will return you a unique, personalized feed.
                    Simply subscribe to the Recast feed instead.</p>
                
                <p>By default Recast will feed you a new episode of the podcast every five days - enough to slowly catch up with most weekly podcasts.  At any time, you can change 
                the frequency new episodes are released, or just release the next episode.</p>
                
                <p>Once you are subscribed to a Recast feed, every episode of the show will include a link to the settings page for that feed.</p>
                
                <h2>Why don't I need an account?</h2>

                <p>Every Recast link that is generated is unique and hard to guess.  Just keep your recast link private and everything will be fine!</p>

            	<h2>Bookmarklet</h2>
            	
                <p>This bookmarklet will pass the address of the current address any page you are on to Recast.  Use it to quickly and easily get a Recast link for a podcast you are 
                interested in.</p>
                
                <p>Simply drag this button onto your bookmark bar:
                    
                    <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="javascript:document.location.href='http://recastthis.com/?feed=' + encodeURIComponent(document.location.href);">Recast This</a>
                </p>

            	<h2>Why aren't all the episodes there?</h2>
            	
            	<p>Recast can only send you episodes that are in the feed today.  Most podcasts have a single feed that includes all the episodes since the start, but they don't have to.
            	If a feed is not complete, Recast cannot send episodes that it doesn't know about.</p>
            	
            	<h2>Why do episodes keep showing up as listened in Overcast?</h2>
            	
            	<p>I wish I knew.  Overcast is my preferred podcast client, but Recast does not play nicely with it.  I am loath to ask for support from Overcast though, because Recast's
            	needs are somewhat niche.  Recast works with every other podcast client I have tried (bear in mind I have no access to Android).</p>
            	
            	<h2>Find out More</h2>
            	
            	<p>Recast is a free project that I created because I couldn't find anything similar and I really wanted to listen to <a href="http://commonplacebooks.com/welcome-to-night-vale">Welcome to Night Vale</a> from the start</p>
            	
            	<p>Recast is open source.  If there's something you want it to do that it currently doesn't, you can get the <a href="https://github.com/xurble/recast">source code from Github</a>, if that sort of thing means anything to you.</p>
